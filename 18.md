# Project 18: Expanding FAIR database integration through elucidation and transformation of underlying graph schemas.

## Abstract

The integration of life science data from different biomedical resources has been a major challenge attributed to fragmented data sources, the use of multiple data formats, and the existence of multiple ontologies for a single context among others. To address this problem, we launched the BioDataFuse (BDF) project, which employs a modular framework for integrating data from different sources into context-specific knowledge graphs. Through this project, we have currently been able to integrate and harmonise data from ten databases. However, the integration of such resources requires a detailed understanding of underlying graph schemas. 

In this biohackathon, we would like to streamline the data integration process such that any FAIR-compliant biological database can be easily converted to a graph. This robust process would involve two steps: first, understanding of the underlying graph schemas of data resources using the RDF-config (https://github.com/dbcls/rdf-config/) and VoID generator (https://github.com/JervenBolleman/void-generator) and second, the conversion of graph data into multiple compatible formats for improving accessibility and usability using G2G Mapper (https://g2gml.readthedocs.io/), LinkML (https://linkml.io/) and BDF (https://github.com/BioDataFuse/pyBiodatafuse). Moreover, we would test the resilience of the process by demonstrating the ease-of-integration of multiple data sources within the RDF Portal (https://rdfportal.org) and beyond. Through this test, we would essentially attract database owners to include additional biomedical data sources in BDF, thus expanding the applicability of their resource beyond the “yet-another-resource” paradigm.
