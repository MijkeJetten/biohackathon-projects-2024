# Project 13: Interconnecting identifiers.org into a broader metadata connectivity

## Abstract

Identifiers.org, an Elixir Recommended Interoperability Service, is a meta-resolver based on a registry which acts as a source of truth, providing a resolution service for compact identifiers, as well as a harmonisation service, based on records which store final resolving locations associated with assigned prefixes. The registry contains metadata on its namespace and resource entries which include valuable information on the data collections, such as ID regex patterns, online resources where identified data objects can be resolved, and associated institutions for these resources. 

We propose exposing this information in RDF format, greatly expanding the interoperability of this service, allowing direct consumption in a variety of ways, for example into Knowledge Graphs. The resulting RDF could be supplemented with several schemas such as DCAT, VoID, and schemas available in BioSchemas. Supplementing the same dataset using different schemas would negate the often-needed practice of mapping, which can be time-consuming. Writing Rest APIs and enabling a SPARQL endpoint for this information would be a more technical challenge. 

Furthermore, expanding the resolver to find related metadata for compact identifiers will enable support for additional use cases, matching the EOSC PID Meta Resolver. For this, we intend to connect our metadata resolver with the BridgeDB ELIXIR resource and the TogoID system from DBCLS. Through additions, identifiers.org will become more useful for its users as an interoperability service that is easily consumable.
