# Project 7: Enhancing the Training metrics database (TMD) for improved reporting

## Abstract

This project aims to extend the functionality of the current Training Metrics Database, to allow for uploading of node specific questions, and establishing a seamless connection to TeSS.

The ELIXIR Training Metrics Database serves as a valuable resource in the ELIXIR Training ecosystem. It collects and aggregates all the training metrics from the different nodes, and is an invaluable resource for generating statistics and reports. Extending the functionality to allow for node specific questions will further increase the usability for the nodes, catering to their unique reporting needs. Moreover, integrating it with TeSS would facilitate automatic data exchange between the two systems, further connecting the ELIXIR ecosystem of resources.

We will achieve this by assembling a team of web developers and training coordinators, creating interactions and collaborations with the TeSS development team.
