# Project 9: BioHackrXiv: improving biohackathon publications

## Abstract

BioHackrXiv.org is the markdown based pre-publishing biohackathon platform for project reporting that is used by the Elixir and Japanese biohackathons and other venues.
The goal of the biohackrxiv is not only to expose work executed during and after biohackathons, but also to increase the scientific profile of participants by giving citeable publications.
During the Biohackathon we want to improve user experience of submitting publication to biohackrxiv.org. Starting at a Japanese biohackathon this work has been mapped out in previous Elixir biohackathons and it is great we can get together an focus our attention on this project.
As a new idea we would like to allow authors to add metadata on their information, websites, source code, data, blogs, videos etc. as a FAIR resource.

Our work has resulted in 73 publications so far, with 200+ authors. The number of submissions is increasing every year. The quality of the publications is very high, in our experience.

A full list of supported hackathons can be found [here](http://preview.biohackrxiv.org/) and a list of publications [here](https://biohackrxiv.org/discover).
