# Project 5: Mapping of research software quality indicators across the ELIXIR Research Software Ecosystem

## Abstract

The primary goal of this project is to perform a cross-walk of indicators around research software quality, creating a comprehensive catalogue that can be used in the context of the ELIXIR Research Software Ecosystem. A common understanding of quality indicators is a well-understood and acknowledged challenge in research software, with different levels of maturity across domains. However, this project will primarily focus on the particular aspects of the ELIXIR community, however aiming for an outcome applicable to the wider Life Science community.

This catalogue will be extremely useful in raising awareness of the existing services, knowing their requirements and expectations, and identifying the optimal service for the particular case. Moreover, it will allow us to identify what could be potential gaps in a particular community, as well as indicators that could be adopted across communities.

The project directly ties into various activities and efforts, both within ELIXIR (Tools Platform Software Best Practices, OpenEBench, Software Observatory, SMPs, STEERS WP2, etc) as well as beyond (EOSC, EVERSE, NFDI4DataScience, etc).

We plan to engage participants in basically all activities. Newcomers can share their experience with research software development, software management, and research software quality.
