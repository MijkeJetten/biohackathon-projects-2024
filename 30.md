# Project 30: The BioHackathon Cloud

## Abstract

We propose the further consolidation of [theBioHackCloud](https://biohack.cloud/)(BHC) - a cloud-based infrastructure for the federated analysis of biological/biomedical data based on Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) standards and other relevant open community standards. The [ELIXIR Cloud](https://elixir-cloud.dcc.sib.swiss/) infrastructure serves as the initial BHC, with mid- to long-term plans of integrating with other cloud infrastructures like [Sapporo](https://github.com/sapporo-wes/sapporo),[Galaxy](https://galaxyproject.org/)/[Pulsar](https://pulsar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/),[Microsoft Azure](https://github.com/microsoft/ga4gh-tes).

The BHC will be offered to interested BioHackathon participants, with BHC project participants providing training and support for the realization of individual use cases (e.g., construction of API calls, making workflows cloud-ready). Feasibility will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, but where use cases cannot be realized with the current infrastructure, their support will be considered for the BHC roadmap or, where possible, will be implemented on site.

Next to supporting other BioHackathon projects and integrating with other cloud infrastructures, another main goal for the BHC project is the implementation of additional features. In this hackathon, a focus will be placed on enhancing data privacy and security features of the BHC by providing Confidential Computing support as developed [byGENXT](https://www.genxt.network/). However, integration with other community standards (e.g.,[RO-Crate](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/) and implementations (e.g.,[WorkflowHub](https://workflowhub.eu/),[BioContainers](https://biocontainers.pro/) is also possible, depending on participantsâ€™ interests.
