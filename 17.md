# Project 17: Development of FAIR image analysis workflows and training in Galaxy

## Abstract

Image analysis tools within Galaxy are currently available but remain underutilised. Last year, our participation in the BioHackathon aimed to enhance the image analysis community in Galaxy. Our focus was on analysing the landscape of tools, gathering and annotating them. It involved community discussions to establish naming conventions, fostering greater standardization of these tools (see outcomes at https://github.com/beatrizserrano/bh2023-preprint/blob/main/BH2023_preprint_project16.pdf). Since then, the integration of tools into Galaxy has continued to expand. This year, our efforts will focus on the exploitation of such tools and showcasing Galaxyâ€™s capabilities in meeting the needs of the imaging community.

In this project, we will develop FAIR image analysis workflows and create comprehensive tutorials within the Galaxy Training Network. We will use sample datasets from public repositories to illustrate diverse image analysis tasks and build the corresponding Galaxy workflows. The resulting workflows will be made available on the Workflowhub.eu. Tutorials will serve as documentation to facilitate the utilisation of these workflows.
