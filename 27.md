# Project 27: Integrating Bioconductor packages with the ELIXIR Research Software Ecosystem using EDAM

## Abstract

This project aims to enhance the ELIXIR Research Software Ecosystem (RSEc) by improving the accessibility, interoperability, and reusability of over 2,000 Bioconductor packages. This involves aligning their description with FAIR principles and setting up their synchronisation with the bio.tools registry. Additionally, this project aims to enhance EDAM's utility by applying the EDAM standard to the large Bioconductor ecosystem. The project utilises structured integration processes and community-centric development to achieve these goals. 

It aligns with the ELIXIR 2024-26 program objectives through the standardisation of Bioconductor software metadata, their inclusion in the RSEc infrastructure, and the community-based improvement of EDAM (Tools platform WP2 and WP3). Feasibility is ensured through planned deliverables, including mapping EDAM and biocViews, manual annotation, and exploring automated mapping tools. Long-term plans involve systematic annotation and synchronisation of Bioconductor packages with bio.tools.
