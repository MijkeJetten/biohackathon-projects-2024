# Project 1: Accelerate your bioinformatics workflows with CGG AI Cloud

## Abstract

CGG is a technology company, with its focus on solving complex scientific problems that involves extremely large volumes of data using vast amount of compute power. We started to operate since 1931 in geophysics and today CGG is a recognized leader for its technology excellence in this field. We are also known for our ability to industrialize (design, deploy and operate), High Performance Computing (HPC) at large scale to support this demanding scientific workload. 

As part of our diversification and expansion efforts, we have opened our HPC operations to other domains where we can make a difference with our expertise in industrializing and optimizing scientific workflows with HPC. Two of the most promising domains for us are bioinformatics and AI and we have recently launched our [CGG AI Cloud](https://www.cgg.com/high-performance-computing/AI-Cloud?utm_source=google&utm_medium=search+ad&utm_campaign=google+cpc+ai+cloud&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwwMqvBhCtARIsAIXsZpaxkJkaMgeYfiGwhI2DVjYIE1-C_gYxCJf4HxuYGk4Rie8Bsn6l3pwaAoIxEALw_wcB) that combines high-performance architecture, including cutting-edge GPUs (NVIDIA H100â€™s) fully configured for AI fine-tuning and inference, and a software environment preinstalled with your preferred AI stack. 

Our project proposal consists of providing all hackers participating in the Biohackathon with access to this cloud so that they have the chance to supercharge their bioinformatic pipelines and optimize their resource utilization together with the exceptional support at every step from our HPC & Cloud solution experts. Our project proposal is to use CGG AI Cloud as Biohackathon compute provider.
