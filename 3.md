# Project 3: Reusable RDM Planning Environments for Trainings and Workshops

## Abstract

Training sessions on Research Data Management (RDM) and data management planning are gaining traction within ELIXIR and beyond. One of the primary platforms for Data Management Plans (DMPs), known as Data Stewardship Wizard (DSW), plays a crucial role in educating researchers on DMP practices. Often utilized across various ELIXIR Nodes and Communities, DSW not only facilitates DMP creation but also serves as an educational tool.

Organizations conducting such training sessions typically need to establish a separate DSW instance dedicated to training purposes. However, the repetitive nature of setting up and cleaning these instances, along with preparing content and user accounts, can be cumbersome. While some organizations have developed custom scripts leveraging the REST API to streamline these tasks, they require ongoing maintenance to align with DSW's monthly release cycle.

In this project, our aim is to develop a service that provides pre-configured sets of content for bootstrapping, cleaning, and verifying DSW instances for training and workshops. These sets will be packaged in a shareable and reusable format, following FAIR principles, allowing organizations to manage their own sets while easily sharing or customizing existing ones. By integrating this service into the open-source codebase, we ensure compatibility and technical readiness aligned with the DSW platform itself. As a result, setting up a testing environment will take mere minutes, if not less.
